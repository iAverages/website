# Website

My new WIP [website](https://danielraybone.com) built in React.js and Typescript

Plans:

- [ ] Include projects I have worked on (Mostly [Secure Heaven](http://secure-heaven.com/) projects)
- [ ] Experience, JS, Express, React, TS, Java,  Mongo, MySQL, whatever else I can think of lol

## What I'm learn while building this

My Typescript knowledge and experience. I've not used TS a whole lot so I'll be using it here.
